# CompressedSensingMRI
Image processing project in medical imaging -- experiment with compressed sensing (CS) framework for MR image reconstruction.
Essentially modeled an objective function as a denoising problem with a data fidelity term and two regularization parameters (horizontal and vertical finite differences)
