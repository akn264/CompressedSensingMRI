README

- brain.mat file was obtained from Prof. Lustic of UC Berkeley. has the image data as well as Gaussian sensing matrix
- Lustig's CS tutorials helped a lot. The FT functions are adapted from his demos because the transform had to be centered. 
- ISTA and soft thresholding functions are from scratch but obviously adapted from what we learned in class and Prof. Selesnick.
